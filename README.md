##Title:
##Road Safety using OBD Big Data Analytics

​

##Problem Statement : ​

As a commuter, I want: 
•	Safer road conditions. – may be early alerts about dangerous drivers around me.
•	Feedbacks about my driving habits and improve to be a safe driver. 
•	To get remote assistance from a mechanic just in case the vehicle breaks down somewhere. 
•	To receive some incentives in my insurance premium or taxes if I have been a safe driver.
•	To give way to ambulances provided I come to know about the approaching ones earlier.
As a government transport authority we want:
•	To improve traffic discipline and traffic sense.
•	Fewer breakdowns of vehicles and a faster recovery.
•	Compliance in terms of pollution levels and vehicle maintenance and overloads.
•	Safer roads, notifications about dangerous drivers/vehicles
•	Notifications for drivers to vacate space for ambulances


##Solution
Our cost effective solution addresses the need of both stakeholders in a viable and scalable manner.
Vehicles generate enormous amount of Onboard Diagnostic Data (OBD) which our solution leverages 
for intelligently analyzing driving patterns for incentivizing good behavior and penalizing bad ones. 
We can detect vehicle runtime and error conditions and thereby take recovery steps. 
Dangerous driving conditions (over speeding, Overloading, damaged car) can be detected and drivers along that road can be alerted.

 

##Future Use cases :

1. Security with added GPS Tracking
2. Fleet Management -example for OLA/ UBER/ Bus Transport companies


##Value Addition:

Conversion of a non smart car into a smart car.
Data for Automobile Manufacturer.
Data for Insurance company.
Data for forensics.
​Smart Fleet Management.
Remote Monitoring




##Solution consist of 3 parts - 

A. Data gathering 
AutomObile Data is available via OBD interface under the dashboard. ELM327 Device will be used 

here.

B. Data Analytics / Processing
Sending data to cloud like Mindsphere/ Firebase/Azure. using a PC or a Raspberry pi windows iot 

hardware.

C. User interfaces / Apps
Alexa enabled interfaces including commands for supporting the above use cases.
